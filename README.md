Once I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around. It was dead silent. Gorgeous. And across the lake I felt incredible love for coding. Since then, my life has changed and I realized what really matters in life. I started to foster my creativity by writing clean code using KISS, SOLID and DRY principles.
